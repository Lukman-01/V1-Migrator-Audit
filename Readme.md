# README: Smart Contract Audit Report

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive audit of smart contracts, including manual audit reports, tool-based analysis (using Slither), unit tests, risk analysis, and recommendations for improvements. Additionally, a recorded video of the audit process is available for reference.

### Contents
The repository is organized into the following folders:
- **Audit Report**: Contains the full manual audit report detailing identified vulnerabilities and recommendations.
- **Audit Tool (Slither)**: Includes the results of the Slither static analysis tool used to scan the contracts for security issues.
- **Unit Tests**: Contains unit test scripts that validate the functionality and security of the contracts.
- **Risk Analysis & Recommendations**: Provides an in-depth risk analysis and a list of recommendations for improving the contract design and mitigating vulnerabilities.
- **Audit PPT**: Contains a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the audit findings, risk distribution, and recommendations.
- **Audit Video**: A screen recording uploaded on YouTube that documents the audit process.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
1. **Manual Audit**: A thorough review of the smart contracts was conducted manually to identify security risks, inefficiencies, and potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Slither**: A static analysis tool used to automatically detect common vulnerabilities in Solidity code.
3. **Solidity Unit Tests**: Unit tests written in Solidity to ensure the correctness of the contract logic and identify potential issues.
4. **PowerPoint**: For presenting the audit findings, risk assessments, and recommendations.
5. **Video Recording**: A screen recording of the audit process has been uploaded to YouTube for transparency and reference.

## How to Run Tests
To run the unit tests for the smart contracts, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) installed. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Unit Tests**:
   Use the Truffle testing framework to run the tests:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Slither Static Analysis**:
   To run Slither for additional static analysis, install Slither following the [official installation guide](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither). After installation, run:
   ```bash
   slither <path-to-your-contracts-directory>

   Or

   slither . <at v1-migrator root folder to run all the contracts>
   ```

## Assumptions Made
- The contracts are written in Solidity and deployable on Ethereum or compatible chains (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Polygon).
- The code is expected to interact with ERC20 tokens and other commonly used Ethereum standards.
- The audit assumes a production deployment scenario, so security risks related to potential attacks, performance optimizations, and gas consumption have been evaluated.

## Audit Video

## Conclusion
This repository provides a thorough audit of the provided smart contracts, with detailed insights into vulnerabilities and recommendations for mitigation. The tools and frameworks used ensure a high level of accuracy, while the documentation is intended to provide clear guidance on addressing the identified issues.
