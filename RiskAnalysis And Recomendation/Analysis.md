### **2. Business Logic Risks**

#### **ACRE, PLOT, and YARD Contracts:**

- **1. Missing Owner in Version 1 of ACRE, PLOT, and YARD Contracts:**
    - **Issue**: In the first version of the **ACRE**, **PLOT**, and **YARD** contracts, the owner of the contract is not set upon deployment. This means that there is no designated account with administrative privileges to manage the contract after deployment.
    - **Risk**: Without an owner or an admin account, crucial functions like upgrading, minting, and transferring funds could be locked or mismanaged. If the ownership is not properly set, it can lead to a situation where no one can modify the contract, perform updates, or retrieve funds if necessary.
    - **Mitigation**: Add a constructor parameter to set the owner during contract deployment. The owner should be set immediately upon deployment using the `Ownable` pattern (from OpenZeppelin) or a similar mechanism. This ensures that a trusted party has administrative control over the contract.

- **2. Arithmetic Overflow in `_pay()` Function of ACRE, PLOT, and YARD Contracts:**
    - **Issue**: In the **ACRE**, **PLOT**, and **YARD** contracts, the `_pay()` function involves performing arithmetic operations (such as transfers and fee calculations) but does not include proper checks for overflow or underflow conditions.
    - **Risk**: The absence of overflow checks can result in incorrect calculations and unintended behavior. For example, a large token transfer or a fee calculation could overflow, leading to incorrect token amounts being sent or received, which could disrupt the contract's operation or create vulnerabilities. This could also open the door for a **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack if attackers exploit these flaws.
    - **Mitigation**: Use the `SafeMath` library (or native Solidity 0.8+ arithmetic checks) to prevent overflow and underflow issues. Ensure all arithmetic operations, especially in critical functions like `_pay()`, are protected. Consider using `require` statements to validate that values fall within expected ranges.

- **3. Lock/Loss of Funds Due to Unchecked `transferFrom()` Return Value:**
    - **Issue**: The **ACRE**, **PLOT**, and **YARD** contracts use `transferFrom()` for token transfers, but they do not check the return value of this function. `transferFrom()` can fail for several reasons, such as insufficient allowance or balance, yet its failure is not always checked.
    - **Risk**: If the `transferFrom()` function fails (returns `false`), the transaction might silently fail, resulting in locked or lost funds without any error or exception being thrown. This can lead to an unintended loss of tokens or a situation where the contract's logic proceeds without the necessary funds.
    - **Mitigation**: Ensure that the return value of `transferFrom()` is checked for success. Solidity's `transferFrom()` function from ERC20 should be wrapped in a `require()` statement to ensure that it successfully transfers the tokens. For example: `require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount), "Transfer failed");`.

- **4. Unused `_tax()` Function:**
    - **Issue**: The **ACRE**, **PLOT**, and **YARD** contracts include a function `_tax()` that is defined but never actually used in the contract's business logic.
    - **Risk**: An unused function introduces unnecessary code complexity, which could confuse developers and auditors. It increases the attack surface without offering any benefits to the contract’s functionality. Additionally, an unused function might be mistakenly referenced in a future update, causing unintended consequences.
    - **Mitigation**: Remove the `_tax()` function from the contract if it is not used in the business logic. This will simplify the code and reduce potential points of failure. If the tax function is intended for future use, ensure that it is clearly marked and documented with comments explaining its intended purpose.

- **5. Missing Zero-Address Validations:**

    - **Issue**: Several functions, including mint, setPaymentToken, and setFeeCollector, lack zero-address validation, allowing the setting of zero addresses for critical parameters.
    - **Risk**: Sending tokens to or interacting with a zero address will result in lost funds or ineffective contract behavior.
    - **Mitigation**: Add a zero-address validation check in relevant functions to ensure that critical addresses are valid.

- **6. Inadequate Validation for Parameters:**

    - **Issue**: Several functions lack proper parameter validation, such as checks for valid amounts or ensuring the values are not negative or zero. For example, in the mint function, the quantity is not checked before use, which could lead to minting of zero or negative amounts.
    - **Risk**: This could lead to unexpected behavior, including minting more tokens than intended, leading to financial loss or an attack vector.
    - **Mitigation**: Introduce proper validation to ensure that parameters like quantity and amounts are greater than zero and fall within reasonable limits (e.g., ensuring quantity > 0).

- **7. Max Buy Amount Logic in YARD Contract:**

    - **Issue**: The mint function in YARD checks if the quantity exceeds a limit but relies solely on the presence of the SIGNER_ROLE for bypassing the limit.
    - **Risk**Risk: This introduces a potential issue if SIGNER_ROLE is mismanaged or if an unauthorized party gains access to the role, potentially bypassing the restriction.
    - **Mitigation**: Ensure additional controls to limit minting, such as enforcing hard-coded limits or requiring multi-signature approvals for critical actions.

#### **BUSD and PRLZ Token Contracts:**

- **Missing Zero-Address Validation:**
    - Issue: Several functions, including `mint`, `setPaymentToken`, and `setFeeCollector`, lack zero-address validation, allowing the setting of zero addresses for critical parameters.
    - Risk: Sending tokens to or interacting with a zero address will result in lost funds or ineffective contract behavior.
    - Mitigation: Add a zero-address validation check in relevant functions to ensure that critical addresses are valid.

- **No Access Control on Mint Function:**
    - Issue: The mint function in **BUSD** and **PRLZ** contracts is publicly accessible. This lack of access control means that anyone can mint tokens at will, leading to uncontrolled supply inflation and potential economic attack.
    - Risk: Potential abuse by malicious actors to mint unlimited tokens, leading to a dilution of token value and undermining the economic stability of the platform.
    - Mitigation: Implement access control using the `onlyOwner` or a similar modifier to restrict minting to authorized addresses only. Ensure that minting is only possible by trusted parties, like contract owners or a designated minter role.

- **Potential Token Symbol/Name Confusion:**
    - Issue: The **PRLZ** token contract uses the symbol "BUSD", which is misleading given its contract name of "PRLZ".
    - Risk: Users could be misled into thinking this token is the widely recognized BUSD, creating confusion and potential phishing risks.
    - Mitigation: Correct the token symbol to match the contract name (e.g., "PRLZ" for the PRLZ token) to prevent confusion and avoid potential impersonation.

- **Mint Function Without Proper Safeguards:**
    - Issue: Both **BUSD** and **PRLZ** contracts allow unlimited minting via the `mint` function, with no limit on the total supply.
    - Risk: Unlimited minting can dilute token value, causing severe economic consequences for holders and potentially making the token worthless.
    - Mitigation: Introduce a maximum supply cap and implement minting controls to ensure minting remains within predefined limits. Only allow minting by trusted parties.

### **3. Deployment Risks**

- **Upgradeability Risks:**
    - Issue: The **YARD** contract inherits from the upgradeable `AccessControlUpgradeable` contract but lacks an effective migration strategy. If the contract needs to be upgraded in the future, there are no clear guidelines or protections against unintentional state changes.
    - Risk: Future upgrades could result in unintended loss of funds or state inconsistencies if not managed properly. Furthermore, improper access control or mismanagement during upgrades could allow unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
    - Mitigation: Implement an upgradeability mechanism using a proxy pattern (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`), and ensure all upgrades are managed by trusted parties with multi-signature approval mechanisms.

- **Fee Collection Mechanism Risks:**
    - Issue: The **YARD** contract relies on `_feeCollector` being set to the contract's owner by default, which means a malicious user who gains control over this address can redirect fee payments.
    - Risk: Mismanagement or attack on the `feeCollector` address could result in loss of funds, especially if the address is not controlled securely.
    - Mitigation: Ensure that the `feeCollector` address is securely managed and that it is possible to change it only through restricted access (e.g., via role-based access or multi-signature wallet).

- **Over-Complexity in Contract Design:**
    - Issue: The **ACRE**, **PLOT**, and **YARD** contracts include intricate batch management, pricing structures, and fee logic, all of which increase the risk of errors in state changes or calculations.
    - Risk: Increased complexity can lead to difficulty in auditing and testing, raising the chances of subtle vulnerabilities, particularly if the logic is not clearly defined or if parameters are misused during state transitions.
    - Mitigation: Simplify contract logic where possible and use thorough automated testing (e.g., Hardhat/Truffle tests) to ensure that all functions work as expected. Additionally, consider performing regular audits after any changes to the codebase.

### **4. Recommended Mitigations**

1. **Parameter Validation and Safe Math Practices:**
   - Add zero-address checks and ensure proper validation for quantities, prices, and other critical parameters.
   - Apply safe math checks where necessary (e.g., for arithmetic operations that could overflow or underflow).

2. **Fix Symbol and Name Inconsistencies:**
   - Correct the token names and symbols to avoid confusion or phishing risks. Ensure the token name matches the intended functionality of the contract.

3. **Max Supply Limit and Minting Control:**
   - Add a maximum supply cap and implement supply controls to ensure minting remains within predefined limits. Only allow minting by trusted parties.

4. **Simplify Business Logic:**
   - Reduce unnecessary complexity in the contract logic to prevent unintentional behavior. Focus on making the contract easier to understand and audit.

5. **Upgradeability Mechanism:**
   - Use proxy patterns (e.g., OpenZeppelin's upgradeable proxy) for contract upgradeability and ensure that only trusted parties have the ability to upgrade the contract.

6. **Transaction Fee Collection:**
   - Implement secure access control for the `feeCollector` address and ensure that fee collection is transparent, with clear audit trails.

7. **Thorough Testing and Auditing:**
   - Conduct extensive automated tests, manual audits, and stress testing before deployment. Continuously monitor contracts after deployment to detect and address issues promptly.
